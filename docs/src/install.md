1. Clone the repository locally: `git clone git@github.com:ITA-Solar/BifrostTools.jl.git`
2. Move to the repo and open the REPL by typing `julia` in your terminal
3. `] add .` installs the package from inside the repository (alternatively `] add PATH/TO/BifrostTools.jl`)

Now you can use BifrostTools.jl in Julia! `> using BifrostTools`
